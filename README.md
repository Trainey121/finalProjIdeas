1) A Family Social Networking/Archive site that would allow users to create a private group, closed to all except family members and provide a private forum 
   to share news, history, photos, videos and recipes with one another.  Sort of a combination of Nextdoor, Facebook, and All Recipes.
    
    Features could include - 
    
    - Users can create their account and then their family group
    - Add family members by email address to the group
    - Designate other family members as administrators - only administrators can approve new members
    - Upload family photos
    - Add recipes to family recipe box
    - Write family history information, include news articles, etc...
    - View and print recipes from family recipe box
    - Post general news/feed comments for family members
    - Edit and view family tree data
    - Organize family photos into "albums"
    - View and maintain family birth, marriage, death and burial records
    - Invite family members to reunions or other family events
 
    
 2)  Elizabeth's Manhattan Cheesecake - an online site for ordering and raving about the worlds best cheesecake.
